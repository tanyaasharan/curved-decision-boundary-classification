# Curved-Decision-Boundary-Classification
This project explores the capabilities of linear versus non-linear classification models when dealing with datasets that inherently possess a curved decision boundary. It highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on the underlying data structure to achieve effective classification.

## Problem Addressed
The central problem is to classify data points into two categories where the separation between them is not a straight line but a curve. Linear models struggle with this type of problem, leading to suboptimal performance.

## Dataset
A synthetic 2D dataset was generated for this binary classification task. This dataset is specifically designed to exhibit a non-linear (curved) decision boundary, making it an ideal test case for comparing linear and non-linear classification algorithms.

## Libraries Used

```
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
pandas
```

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression: Serving as a baseline linear classifier.
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): Utilized as a non-linear classifier.

## Methodlogy
- The project systematically compares the performance of Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on a synthetic 2D dataset.
- Both models were trained, and their ability to define a decision boundary was visually represented to demonstrate how each model attempts to classify the data.
- Performance was evaluated using a suite of standard classification metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC AUC

## Results
The results clearly illustrate the performance disparity between linear and non-linear models on data with curved boundaries:

1. Logistic Regression: As expected, the linear decision boundary generated by Logistic Regression was unable to effectively separate the two classes, resulting in lower performance metrics. The visualized boundary was a straight line that poorly fit the curved data distribution.

2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): In contrast, the MLP model successfully learned a non-linear decision boundary that closely approximated the curved separation in the synthetic dataset. This was reflected in significantly higher accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Key Insights

The project provides a clear demonstration of the limitations of linear models when data exhibits non-linear relationships. It underscores that:

1. For data with inherently non-linear structures, non-linear models like MLPs are essential to accurately capture the underlying patterns and achieve higher classification performance.

2. Visualizing decision boundaries is a powerful tool for understanding how models operate and for diagnosing their suitability for a given problem.
